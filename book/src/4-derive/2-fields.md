# Fields
Struct fields are mapped to Toql query fields and database columns by default in a predictable way:
1. Table names are UpperCamelCase.
2. Column names are snake_case.
3. Toql query fields are lowerCamelCase.
4. Toql query paths are lowerCamelCase, separated with an underscore.


## Renaming tables and columns
To adjust the default naming to an existing database scheme use the attributes `tables` and `columns` for a renaming scheme or `table` and `column` for explicit name.

Supported renaming schemes are 
- CamelCase
- snake_case
- SHOUTY\_SNAKE\_CASE
- mixedCase

#### Renaming scheme example
```rust
#[derive(Toql)]
#[toql(tables="SHOUTY_SNAKE_CASE", columns="UpperCase")]
struct User {
	#[toql(key)]
  	user_id: u32
	full_name: String,
}
```
is translated into 

`SELECT t0.UserId, t0.FullName FROM USER_REF t0`

#### Explicit naming example
Use `table` an the struct and `column` on the fields to set a name.

```rust
#[derive(Toql)]
#[toql(table="User")]
struct UserRef {

	#[toql(key, column="id")]
	user_id: u32,

	full_name: String,
}
```
is translated into 

`SELECT t0.id, t0.full_name FROM User t0`

Use `column` also when mapping a field, that is a SQL keyword. Notice the back ticks:
```rust
#[toql(column="`order`")]
	order: u32,
```

### Toql query fields

Toql query fields on a struct are always mixed case, while dependencies are separated with an underscore.

```rust
#[derive(Toql)]
#[toql(table="User")]
struct UserRef {

	#[toql(key, column="id")]
	id: u32

	full_name: String,

	#[toql(join())]
	county: Country
}
```
is referred to as

`id, fullName, country_id`



## Exclusion
Fields can be excluded in several ways
- `skip` excludes a field completely from the table, use for non-db fields.
- `skip_mut` ensures a field is never updated, automatically added for keys and SQL expressions.
- `skip_wildcard` removes a field from default [wildcard selection](../5-query-language/2-select.md), use for expensive SQL expressions or soft hiding.


```rust
#[derive(Toql)]
#[toql(table="User")]
struct UserRef {
	
	#[toql(key, column="id")]
	id: u32

	full_name: String,

	#[toql(skip_wildcard)]
	middle_name: String,

	#[toql(skip)]
	value: String,

	#[toql(join(), skip_mut)]
	country: Country
}
```
