//! # Insert / Delete / Update
//!
//! The database support of the Toql derive can build functions to insert, delete and update structs.
//!
//! ## Example (Read the guide for derive attributes)
//!
//! ``` ignore
//! #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Toql)]
//! struct NewUser {
//!     #[toql(skip_inup)]
//!     id: u8, // Auto value, no insert
//!     username: Option<String>,
//! }
//!
//! let u = NewUser {
//!             id: 5,
//!             username: Some(String::from("Foo")),
//!         };
//!
//! let (sql, params) = NewUser::insert_one_sql(&u)?.unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!("INSERT INTO NewUser (username) VALUES (?)", sql);
//! assert_eq!(["Foo"], *params);
//! ```
//!
//! Note that operations are not cascaded. If you insert a struct `Foo` that contains another struct `Bar` only `Foo will be inserted.
//! To deal with those dependencies, you are expected to make multiple calls.
//!
//! If you *update* a struct, fields of type `Option<>` with value `None` are skipped. Read the guide for details!
